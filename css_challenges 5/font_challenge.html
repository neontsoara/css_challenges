    <p1>The repercussions of child abuse and the impact of abuse on their journey to adulthood is also severe, Greene stresses. Research evidence shows that such abuse has long-lasting psychosocial consequences that impact the social development of children differently. Where girls are victimised for instance, the consequence of abuse can lead to depression, anxiety disorders, substance use disorder, eating disorders, suicidal tendencies, and unwanted pregnancy.

“Boys in turn are prone to manifesting behaviour such as truanting, gang involvement, and crime.  “In addition, children who are abused are often in physical and emotional pain at school; they cannot concentrate on schoolwork, and consequently fall behind in their grades. They often find it hard to make or keep friends, and may be victimized by bullies or become bullies themselves.

Sadly, in adult life, abuse survivors are at risk of repeating childhood patterns through forming relationships with abusive spouses, employers, or professionals,” Greene explains.</p1>

<p2>Alas, the journey to recovery is long. “Abused adults and children often require long-term psychological treatment including trauma counselling and psychotherapy in order to treat specific mental health disorders and to learn new ways of dealing with distorted thoughts/feelings (new coping skills).”

She adds that it is difficult to pinpoint whether abuse against women or against children, is most rife.  “Partly this is due to the lack of reporting any form of abuse, and the classification of such abuse when reported. Domestic violence is often captured as assault, and therefore statistics will be incorrect.

Victims are often less likely to report cases of mental/ emotional and financial abuse as these are often viewed in a less serious light, as it often leaves no physical evidence.

“If you suspect that a person or loved one is suffering from some of other form of abuse, approach them in a safe place, using a non-judgemental manner. Encourage them to reach out to organisations that can help,” Greene concludes.</p2>
